# Vehicle Plate Number Recognition
## General Project Description
The Vehicle Plate Number Recognition project aims to develop a system that can automatically recognize the license plate numbers of authoried vehicles entering our university campus 

## Version 1.0
In the first version of the project, we have developed a web application that allows users to upload a vehicle photo. The application uses Google Vision API and FastAPI to recognize the plate number in the uploaded image. This version of the project is functional and has been tested successfully.

## Demo

## Future Development
We plan to continue developing this project by integrating it with our university's security system to automatically allow authorized vehicles to enter the campus. We also plan to implement real-time video recognition for improved accuracy and speed. Stay tuned for future updates!
